# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
This project focuses on building an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images belonging to 10 different classes, including animals, vehicles, and everyday objects.
